python 101 
so far i learn about 
basic data types (lists, tuples, dictionaries, booleans, floats, ints, strings, list-comprehension), 
classes (initializing classes, adding meathods, removing methods, inheriting from parent/super classes, extending from multiple classes), 
functions (what are arguments and parameters, positional arguments, keword arguments, default parameters, arbitrary arguments), 
control flows (if/elif/else, while/for loops), 
error handling (try/expect/else), 
user input(input fn), 
working with the file system (reading and writing)
